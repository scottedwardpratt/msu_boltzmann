This is a helper class that handles the CInelasticInfo objects. The class provides a list structure similar to the CResList class, with similar functionality. It handles reading in, organizing, and storing the various CInelasticInfo objects.

This is to improve model function time, as the creation of the array (especially if UseInelasticArray = true) can be quite computationally intensive.

However, unlike the MergeArray, the sheer number of CInelasticInfo objects in the array mean that it is extremely computationally intensive to create and store the array. As such, this method is basically depreciated, and will be addressed in future revisions.
